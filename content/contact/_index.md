<h1>Contact MySkinin

<h2>Do you have a skin care question? 

Send it to us! This whole site got started because I liked figuring out the various issues my skin threw at me like puzzles. I started doing the same thing for family and friends. I'll be happy to try to do that for you as well! I'll do my best to either create a blog post or answer you directly. Chance are that I or one of the contributors to this blog has come across something similar and we'll be glad to share our insight with you. We also have an extensive network of beauticians and skin care gurus who will be more than happy to pitch in!

<h2>Do you want to partner with us? 

We work with select affiliate programs. Where we feel a product is particularly good and suitable to our reader's concerns, we may may choose to feature it in our blog. We are particularly interested in innovative, research based skin care solutions, teqniques and immerging brands. We love the idea of efficiency and have a particular appreciation for products that multi-task. However, we understand that skincare is a long term game and tend to be sceptical of "overnight miracle cures".
