Our aim is to share decades of skin care obsession with you. We don’t want to post a bunch of Photoshopped before/after photos and make you believe that we recommend miraculous cures. We do want to share with you logic and reasons for why what we recommend works. 

Good skin is one of the most beautiful and attractive things you can wear. It can mean less make up. It can make an old ratty T-shirt look amazing because of the smooth glowing shoulder peaking from underneath it. It can mean being mistaken for a goddess! 

Do you have other skin care questions? Please let us know by commenting below! We’ll do our best to create a post to answer your questions. 

We are a group of friends - women of 20, 30 and 40 something range. We are of varied skin types, beauty budget and time available for self care. However, we all fundamentally believe that taking care of our skin is by far, the most important part of beauty.
