Finding the perfect skin care routine for your face is great, but a routine for skin care for your body is a must too. Just as you should use a facial cleanser, exfoliator, and moisturizer (and more) on your face, you should also use skin care products on the skin below your neck. Dry, itchy, aged skin on your body takes away from the glowing complexion you've worked so hard to achieve.

If you've been neglecting the skin on your body, it's time to create a body skin care routine. A basic body skin care routine can be easy and fast. You just need a bit of organisation and the right tools.

> The key to a perfect body skin care routine is finding one that is easy enough for you to stick with, yet will go beyond what you are doing. Don't add a million new steps and don't create such a lengthy routine that you won't have time for it. Simple, new and easy is key.

<h3> Step 1: Get clean

The first part of a good body skin care routine should be cleansing. Choose a body cleanser with enough power to remove dirt and grease, but not so much that it will strip your skin of natural oils and make it dry. We love <a href="https://amzn.to/2X29k9C">CeraVe's hydrating body wash</a> because it cleans without attacking the skin barrier. If you prefer a body cleanser with scent, we love <a href="https://amzn.to/2CuEe18">Fenjal's Creme Body Wash</a>. It's classic and timeless Swiss formula that leaves your skin cleansed, soft and nourished. It also has a pleasant and not too heavy fragrance that lingers on your skin.

<h3> Step 2: Exfoliate

A body skin routing should involve exfoliation at least 1-2 times per week. Exfoliation helps remote dead skin cells, can improve circulation and reduce the appearance of cellulite. We recommend exfoliating with a body scrub, a body brush or an exfoliating glove. We find body scrubs to be the most thorough form of exfoliation. <a href="https://amzn.to/32AIyGD">Body brushes</a> have a better impact on the appearance of cellulite and <a href="https://amzn.to/36V6KXB">exfoliating gloves<a/> tend to be the fastest since you just put them on your hands and scrub away.

<h3> Step 3: Shave

Scrubbing your skin regularly will make your shave even smoother and easier. Once you're ready, either use your own, already proven method, or check out this <a href="http://bit.ly/2Q4i4Lb">shaving guide</a>.

<h3> Step 4: Dry Off

Did you know that your post shower towel is another opportunity to exfoliate your skin? We love <a href="https://amzn.to/2O0Z1Ph">towels that have a bit more texture</a> to give your skin a free exfoliation session. We recommend washing your towels frequently and giving them plenty of space to dry. Wet towels are prime breeding ground for bacteria and you want to give them little chance for survival. <a href="https://amzn.to/2O2twnW">This one by Aquis<a/> offers texture and fast drying.

<h3> Step 5: Moisturise

Hydration is key for soft, smooth skin. However, many people skip it because it's a bit time consuming. We find that using a <a href="https://amzn.to/36Vah8j">moisturing spray</a> and leaving your skin just slightly damp post toweling off makes the job much faster and easier. Spray moisturiser saves your the time of having to pump of squeeze the moisturiser on to your body. It also saves you the need to spread it. With a spray, you can eliminate those two steps. Just spray the moisturiser all over and just rub it a bit. We find that <a href="https://amzn.to/36Vah8j">this version from Neutrogena</a> absorbs very quickly and easily.
