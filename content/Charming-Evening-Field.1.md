If you want to know how to use a body scrub, please keep reading. In this guide, you are going to learn how to exfoliate the body like a pro. 

We show you how to use a coffee scrub, sugar scrub, seasalt scrub and other types of body scrubs. We also share secrets used by high end spas that you can easily replicate at home. 
“OMG! Is that human skin?” is a typical reaction after following our process. 

The key to understanding how to use an exfoliating body scrub effectively is choosing the body scrub that is most appropriate for your needs. Before using a body scrub at home, it is imperative to prepare your skin appropriately. You must also apply a body scrub in a way that won’t damage your skin or cause adverse results. We cover all of this information and show you a quick method and a longer one. 


<h2>How to apply a body scrub [Luxury Spa Tips At Home]

The key to using body scrub is preparing your skin. The main idea is to soften the surface of your skin so that the body scrub can achieve maximum sloughing of dead skin cells. Preparation can be done in a number of ways and depends on the amount of time you have and how much you want to fuss with it. We will give you a couple of options. 

<h3>Option 1: When you have a lot of time and a lot of products.

Ideally, you would be able to steam your skin at a sauna. However, a sauna can be easily replicated at home by running the shower on a hot setting for about 5 minutes. Always point the hot water away from yourself. Depending on the size of your bathroom, it should start to fill up with steam fairly quickly. If you have a cabin shower, you can step inside and put the water on as hot as you can without burning yourself. Again, direct the water away from yourself and be very careful to avoid burns. Your skin should not get wet. It’s about steaming. Make sure the ventilation is off and that the main door and windows are shut.  If at any time you start to feel dizzy or unwell, immediately open the main door, windows, etc. to let the steam out. Always keep a bottle of cold water nearby and sip it while the steam is coming and during the steaming process.

Once there is steam, sit there for a few minutes or until you feel the typical “I’ve had enough sauna” effect. Then, step into the bath/shower if you’ve been sitting outside of it. Rub Maroccan black soap all over your body. Maroccan black soap has been used for centuries to help remove dead skin cells, dirt, and pollution build up while keeping skin smooth and supple.  We love  Beldi Soap from Kahina Giving Beauty because of the intoxicating Neroli scent that's reminiscent of jasmine. It softens like no other and best of all, a portion of the profits go towards supporting programs that improve the lives of Berber women. This feels like a true luxury treat and you feel doubly good because you’ve helped someone else. 

Rinse the Maroccan soap and dry your body. Step back into the shower and apply a body mask. (You can also skip to the next step if you prefer to save a bit of time.) We love 417 Body Wrap Dead Sea Catharsis Mask because our skin felt ultra smooth after using it. The brand also says that it helps with cellulite with longer term use. We definitely saw an improvement in the dimples on our thighs after using it once, but we cannot say whether this was as a result of the whole ritual or just the 417 body mask. 

Finally, follow all steps from Option 2 (below). By the time you finish, you will feel like an absolute goddess! 

<h3>Option 2: When you have little time and want to use fewer products.

While standing in the shower/bath and BEFORE you turn on the water, run shower oil all over your skin. It is absolutely imperative that you do this before you get your skin wet because the oil will stick to your skin better and will have a fantastic softening effect.  Spread the oil generously and be sure to cover every part that you want exfoliated, especially tougher areas like your elbows and palms. If you are also exfoliating your feet, it is advisable to use a shower stool or to sit on the floor of your shower/bathtub. Be very careful not to slip - oil is slippery.  It is advisable to use a shower oil because they will rinse much easier when it’s time to wash everything off. We love Rituals Rose and Almond Oil. The scent is absolutely divine and our skin was softer than ever before. It also has the right balance of slipperiness and sticks to your skin well enough for the next step.  

Take a small scoop of your body scrub into your hand and start spreading it, focusing on one area at a time such as an arm, leg, stomach, back etc. Massage it in small circular motions upwards. Avoid pulling on your skin and avoid large movements - in the long run unnecessary tugging will only exacerbate wrinkles and sagging. We love Rituals Rose and Almond Oil scrub because it has the perfect consistency and texture to give us baby soft skin. 

Once you finished an area, move on to the next. Don’t forget your hands and palms. Also, be sure to cover the underside of your arms - most people tend to neglect this area! 

Finally, rinse it while helping it along with a soapy loofah. After you dry with a towel, if you have time, follow with a skin softening oil such as Avene Body Oil. We like this oil because it absorbs quickly and leaves your skin super soft. However, it’s worth noting that it should only be used on the body and won’t double as a facial or hair oil. 

<h2>Making your body scrub last longer

Now that you know how to use your body scrub properly, we’d like to show you how to make the results last longer. The key here depends on the season and type of climate you live in. If it’s cold/dry - moisturisers are your best bet. However, we recommend avoiding overly heavy ones because they will clog your pores, cause breakouts and unsightly bumps.

Warmer weather calls for light moisturisers and a deeper cleansing body wash that will de-gunk your pores after sweat. 

Humidity is your friend when it comes to keeping your skin supply and making the effects of your body scrub last. The only downside of it is that smog and gunk tends to stick to your skin. Fear not! We recommend dry brushing (putting a bit of body oil on the brush beforehand makes magic!) or using a good loofah. 

Heading 2: What’s the best body scrub?

The best body scrub is the one that is most appropriate for your skin type. The grain size of the body scrub should parallel your skin. The finer and more delicate your skin, the finer and more delicate the body scrub. Do a patch test before purchasing and if the body scrub feels painful,  like it’s pulling at your skin or leaves a lasting redness, do not buy it. Using a scrub that is too coarse can lead to micro scarring and make your skin rougher in the long term. It is better to use as fine of a grain as possible, yet still effective on your skin. It should feel like a tiny, pleasant massage. (Later in this guide we show you the trick spa’s use to get the most out of these tiny grains. Please keep reading.) 

Be sure to look at the consistency of the body scrub. A body scrub consists of a liquid part and the scrub particles. The liquid serves as an adhesive, skin lubricant and carrier for the scrub particles. You need some liquid, but you don’t want too much because it won’t be effective. You’re looking for a high density of scrub particles. 

Body scrub ingredients such as coffee, sugar, salt or another type of scrub should correspond to your needs. Coffee has been shown to help cellulite. Seasalt can have a lot of helpful minerals. Both are said to have de-puffing properties. Sugar, we are less fond of because of it’s aging properties. Also, be sure to check the other ingredient in the body scrubs to make sure that it doesn’t contain ingredients you wish to avoid or known allergens.
